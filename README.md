# Run Buddy, Inc

A front-end website created for a fitness training service provider that includes a sign-up form, a description of the services, and contact information.

## Methodologies Used

- Interpreted a mockup from designers by dividing it into containers.
- Followed accessability best practices.
- Nested browser content from another page using `<iframe>`.
- Created feature branches to allow multiple versions of the development environment to exist.
- Used flexbox and media queries to make the page scaleable and responsive.
- Used pseudo-classes to set different element states.
